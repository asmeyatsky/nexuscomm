- **Investigation Updates**: Every 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity (typically 1-4 weeks)
- **Public Disclosure**: After patch release (typically 30-90 days)

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Data Minimization**: We collect only data necessary for functionality

### Infrastructure Security
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, and prevention systems
- **DDoS Protection**: Protection against distributed denial of service attacks
- **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic third-party security assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing by security experts

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Strict input validation and sanitization
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication and secure session management
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and brute force attacks
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security-focused HTTP headers

### Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Regular Updates**: Timely updates of all dependencies
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of dependency integrity

## Bug Bounty Program

We operate a bug bounty program to reward security researchers who help us improve our security.

### Scope
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Mobile application vulnerabilities
- API security issues
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization bypasses

### Out of Scope
- Denial of service attacks
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Vulnerabilities in unsupported versions
- Issues requiring physical access to user devices

### Rewards
Rewards are based on the severity of the vulnerability:
- **Critical**: $5,000 - $10,000
- **High**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Medium**: $250 - $1,000
- **Low**: $50 - $250

### Eligibility
- Researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices
- Vulnerabilities must be previously unreported
- Proof of concept must be provided
- No automated scanner reports without manual verification

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
2. **Code Reviews**: All code changes require security review
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning
4. **Environment Separation**: Separate development, staging, and production environments
5. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

### For Users
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA wherever possible
3. **Software Updates**: Keep all software up to date
4. **Phishing Awareness**: Be cautious of suspicious communications
5. **Privacy Settings**: Review and configure privacy settings regularly

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, we follow these procedures:

1. **Detection**: Continuous monitoring for security events
2. **Assessment**: Immediate assessment of impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Rapid containment to prevent further damage

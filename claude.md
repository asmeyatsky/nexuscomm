# Claude AI Guidelines for NexusComm Mega App

## 🎯 Mission
Assist in building a robust, scalable, and maintainable mega app while maintaining strict quality standards and preventing scope creep.

---

## 📋 Core Principles

### 1. **Code Quality First**
- NO shortcuts, hacks, or "temporary" code that becomes permanent
- All code must follow the project's established patterns and conventions
- Refactor before adding new features if needed
- Reject requests to disable linters, type checking, or security tools
- Enforce comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. **Scope Management**
- Keep features focused and well-defined
- Flag scope creep immediately and ask for clarification
- One feature per task/PR - avoid bundling unrelated changes
- Document design decisions before implementation
- Break large features into smaller, testable chunks

### 3. **Testing Requirements**
- All new code must have corresponding tests
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Write tests BEFORE implementation when possible (TDD)
- No merging code with failing tests
- Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests

### 4. **Performance & Scalability**
- Measure and optimize before claiming performance is "good enough"
- Consider database query efficiency from the start
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Monitor bundle sizes and load times
- Flag potential bottlenecks early

### 5. **Security & Data Protection**
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS/secure protocols
- Audit external dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

## 🚨 Hard Stops - Claude Must Refuse These Requests

1. **Code Quality Violations**
   - Disabling linters, type checking, or security scanners
   - Adding "TODO: fix later" comments without a tracking issue
   - Copy-pasting code without understanding it
   - Using deprecated APIs or libraries

2. **Testing Shortcuts**
   - Skipping tests or test suites (`xtest`, `skip()`, etc.)
   - Writing code without tests unless explicitly agreed upon
   - Removing existing tests to "make build pass"

3. **Security Issues**
   - Committing secrets or credentials
   - Disabling security features or warnings
   - Using unvalidated user input in queries or system commands
   - Storing passwords in plaintext

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Building features not explicitly discussed
   - Refactoring unrelated code while fixing a bug
   - Adding "nice-to-have" features mid-implementation

5. **Documentation**
   - Leaving code undocumented if it's complex
   - Creating breaking changes without migration guides
   - Removing API documentation when deprecating features

## ✅ Required Standards

### Architecture & Code Organization
- [ ] Follow established project structure and naming conventions
- [ ] One responsibility per file/function
- [ ] Maximum function length: 50 lines (refactor if longer)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data layer)

### Type Safety
- [ ] No `any` types without explicit justification
- [ ] Strict null/undefined checks enabled
- [ ] All function parameters and returns properly typed
- [ ] Generic types used appropriately

### Testing Standards
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user paths
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] All edge cases documented and tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Complex functions have JSDoc/docstrings
- [ ] API endpoints documented (request/response)
- [ ] Setup and installation instructions maintained
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Page load time < 3s (core pages)
- [ ] API response time < 500ms (p95)
- [ ] Database queries optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Bundle size monitored
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented

## 🔍 Code Review Checklist (Claude Enforces)

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] All tests pass and new tests added
- [ ] No console logs left in production code
- [ ] No commented-out code (use git history instead)
- [ ] TypeScript/linter errors resolved
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] API contracts maintained or versioned
- [ ] Database migrations included (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## 📊 Metrics & Monitoring

Track and maintain:
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for critical paths
- **Build Time**: Alert if increases > 10%
- **Test Duration**: Alert if increases > 20%
- **Type Safety**: 0% implicit `any` usage
- **Linting**: 0 errors, minimize warnings
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 0 unresolved critical/high

## 🛑 Common Pitfalls - Claude Flags These Immediately

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| "Just one more thing" mid-feature | Stop and split into separate task |
| "We'll optimize later" | Reject and do it now |
| "Tests slow down development" | Reject - write tests first |
| "Disable this warning" | Ask why, likely a code smell |
| "I'll document it eventually" | Document now or reject |
| "This is just for testing" | Remove before commit |
| "No one will use this edge case" | Still needs to be handled |

## 🔄 Claude's Working Pattern

1. **Clarify**: Ask questions if requirements are ambiguous
2. **Plan**: Create a todo list and get approval for approach
3. **Implement**: Follow all standards listed above
4. **Test**: Verify coverage and functionality
5. **Review**: Self-review against checklist
6. **Document**: Update docs, comments, ADRs as needed
7. **Report**: Summarize changes and any concerns

## ⚙️ Configuration & Tool Usage

### Linting & Type Checking
- Run linter before each commit
- Type checking must pass (0 errors)
- Auto-formatters enabled and configured
- Pre-commit hooks enforced

### Testing
- Run full test suite before PR
- Coverage reports generated
- Failing tests block merges

### Git
- Descriptive commit messages (imperative mood)
- Reference issue numbers: `Fixes #123`
- No force pushes to main/develop
- Feature branches for all work

---

## 📝 Feature Request Template

When starting a new feature, Claude requires:

```
## Feature: [Name]

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User impact/benefit
- [ ] Technical complexity estimate

**Design:**
- [ ] Architecture approach
- [ ] Data model changes (if any)
- [ ] API changes (if any)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test scenarios identified
- [ ] Performance impact considered
- [ ] Edge cases listed

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Documentation
```

## 🤝 Escalation Protocol

Claude escalates to human review if:
- Architectural changes required
- Security implications unclear
- Performance impact uncertain
- Breaking API changes
- Major refactoring scope
- Requirements conflict
- Estimate > 4 hours

---

## ✨ Success Criteria

The mega app succeeds when:
✅ Code is maintainable and well-tested
✅ Performance meets targets
✅ Security is not an afterthought
✅ Documentation matches reality
✅ Onboarding new devs takes < 1 day
✅ Refactoring is safe and easy
✅ Bugs are rare and quickly fixed
✅ Team confidence is high
